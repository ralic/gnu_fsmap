# free software concept map readme

This map is prepared, since version 4 of the map (the first full hypermap version) to be readed with free browsers suporting SVG standard. 

To modify, print or see it well it's recomended to use Inskcape.

If you need one very little version, then it's recomended to open inkscape, select all the map and click Path / Object to Path.  
The little versions of the map will be more readable because letters aren't well reduced.

If you have any sugestion, please send it. :)
